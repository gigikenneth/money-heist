# MoneyHeist Notebook

This is my first attempt at making a README so don't judge me. And working on random datasets and projects while learning more about AI.

Here, you'll find very random visualizations using the Money Heist dataset from Seasons 1 to 6. 

I came across the dataset on Kaggle and you can check it out [here](https://www.kaggle.com/omkar2018/money-heist-season-1-to-5).

## Installation

None required.

```bash
pip install nope!
```

## Usage

```python
